# Credits

The idea to create this project comes from freeCodeCamp's localStorage to-do list
project. I wanted to create my own version of the project that I could use daily,
as I often scribble down my to-do on scratch paper. This project helps me reduce waste
and clutter, and keeps my information centralized. I used freeCodeCamp's edit, delete,
and update functions to help inspire my own.
